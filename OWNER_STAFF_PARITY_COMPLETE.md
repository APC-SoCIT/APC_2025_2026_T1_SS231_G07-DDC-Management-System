## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. Fixed React Key Warning ✅
**File:** `frontend/app/staff/appointments/page.tsx`

**Issue:** Fragment without key prop in map function
```tsx
// BEFORE (Error)
{appointments.map((apt) => (
  <>
    <tr key={apt.id}>
```

**Fix:** Added Fragment import and moved key to Fragment
```tsx
// AFTER (Fixed)
import { useState, Fragment } from "react"

{appointments.map((apt) => (
  <Fragment key={apt.id}>
    <tr>
```

Also updated closing tag from `</>` to `</Fragment>`

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. React Key Warning in Appointments ✅
**Error Message:**
```
Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.
Check the render method of 'StaffAppointments'.
```

**Root Cause:** Fragment wrapper in map function didn't have key prop

**Solution:** 
1. Import Fragment from React
2. Move key from inner `<tr>` to outer `<Fragment>`
3. Update closing tag to `</Fragment>`

### 2. Owner Missing Staff Features ✅
**Issue:** Owner couldn't access appointments, inventory, services pages with full functionality

**Solution:** Copied all staff pages to owner with proper function naming

## 🔒 Permission Verification

### Backend Permission Checks (Already Implemented)
```python
# Pattern used across all ViewSets
def get_queryset(self):
    user = self.request.user
    if user.user_type == 'patient':
        return Model.objects.filter(patient=user)
    return Model.objects.all()  # Staff and Owner see all
```

This pattern ensures:
- ✅ Patients only see their own data
- ✅ Staff see all data (except analytics and staff management)
- ✅ Owner see all data (including analytics and staff management)
