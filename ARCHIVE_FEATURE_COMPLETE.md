## Technical Implementation Details

### API Integration
```typescript
// Archive patient
await api.archivePatient(patientId, token)
// Backend: POST /api/users/{id}/archive/

// Restore patient  
await api.restorePatient(patientId, token)
// Backend: POST /api/users/{id}/restore/

// Get archived patients
const archived = await api.getArchivedPatients(token)
// Backend: GET /api/users/archived_patients/
```

### State Management
```typescript
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState<"all" | "active" | "inactive" | "new" | "archived">("all")
const [archivedPatients, setArchivedPatients] = useState<Patient[]>([])
const displayPatients = activeTab === "archived" ? archivedPatients : patients
```

### Smart Fetching
- Active patients are always fetched
- Archived patients are only fetched when "Archived" tab is clicked
- Auto-refresh after archive/restore operations
- Error handling with user-friendly alerts

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Better Organization**: Archived patients don't clutter active patient lists
‚úÖ **Data Preservation**: Patients aren't deleted, just archived
‚úÖ **Easy Recovery**: One-click restore from archived tab
‚úÖ **Clear Visual Feedback**: Color-coded buttons (orange for archive, green for restore)
‚úÖ **Safe Operations**: Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental actions
‚úÖ **Consistent UX**: Same functionality for both staff and owner roles
