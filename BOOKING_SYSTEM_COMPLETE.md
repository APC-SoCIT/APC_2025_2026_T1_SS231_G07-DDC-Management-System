## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Variables Added
```typescript
const [selectedDate, setSelectedDate] = useState<Date | undefined>(undefined)
const [dentistAvailability, setDentistAvailability] = useState<any[]>([])
const [availableDates, setAvailableDates] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set())
const [bookedSlots, setBookedSlots] = useState<Array<{date: string, time: string, dentist_id: number}>>([])
const [patientSearchQuery, setPatientSearchQuery] = useState("")
```

### Imports Added
```typescript
import { Calendar } from "@/components/ui/calendar"
import { Calendar as CalendarIcon } from "lucide-react" // Renamed to avoid conflict
```

### Helper Functions Updated

#### `isTimeSlotBooked()`
Now checks against system-wide booked slots:
```typescript
const isTimeSlotBooked = (date: string, time: string, dentistId?: string) => {
  if (!dentistId) return false
  
  return bookedSlots.some(
    slot => slot.date === date && 
            slot.time === time && 
            slot.dentist_id === Number(dentistId)
  )
}
```

#### `formatDentistName()`
Shows role alongside name:
```typescript
const formatDentistName = (dentist: Staff) => {
  const role = dentist.user_type === 'owner' ? 'Owner' : 'Dentist'
  return `${dentist.first_name} ${dentist.last_name} (${role})`
}
```

### useEffect Hooks Added

1. **Fetch Dentist Availability**
   - Runs when dentist selection changes
   - Calculates available dates for 90 days
   - Matches against dentist's weekly schedule

2. **Update Date from Calendar**
   - Runs when calendar date is selected
   - Converts Date object to YYYY-MM-DD format
   - Updates newAppointment.date

3. **Fetch Booked Slots**
   - Runs when dentist or date changes
   - Fetches system-wide booked appointments
   - Filters by dentist and date

### Conflict Checking Updated
```typescript
// OLD: Only checked local appointments array
const hasConflict = appointments.some(apt => ...)

// NEW: Checks against system-wide booked slots
const hasConflict = isTimeSlotBooked(newAppointment.date, newAppointment.time, newAppointment.dentist)
```

  type="text" 
  placeholder="Search patient by name or email..."
  // Real-time filtering
/>
<select>
  {/* Filtered results */}
</select>
```

### Calendar Section
