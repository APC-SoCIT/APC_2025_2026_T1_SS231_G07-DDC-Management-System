# Critical Fixes Applied ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Staff Appointment Modal - Updated to New Calendar System
**Problem**: Staff page was still using the old basic form (date input + simple time picker)  
**Solution**: Replaced entire modal with patient-side functionality including:
- Patient search with filtering
- Dentist selection (required first)
- Calendar with availability highlighting
- Smart time slot grid with double-booking prevention
- Service selection
- Notes field

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/app/staff/appointments/page.tsx`

---

### 2. ✅ Owner Dentist Dropdown - Shows Only Owner Bug
**Problem**: When owner tried to book appointment, dentist dropdown only showed the owner, not all dentists  
**Solution**: 
- Updated Staff interface to include optional `role` field
- Enhanced filter to check both `user_type` and `role` fields
- Removed redundant filter in the dropdown rendering

**Before**:
```typescript
// Only checked user_type
setStaff(staffData.filter((s: Staff) => s.user_type === 'dentist' || s.user_type === 'owner'))

// Then filtered AGAIN in dropdown
{staff.filter((s) => s.user_type === 'dentist' || s.user_type === 'owner').map(...)}
```

**After**:
```typescript
// Checks both user_type and role fields
setStaff(staffData.filter((s: Staff) => 
  s.user_type === 'dentist' || 
  s.user_type === 'owner' || 
  s.role === 'dentist' || 
  s.role === 'owner'
))

// No filter in dropdown (already filtered)
{staff.map((s) => (...))}
```

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/app/owner/appointments/page.tsx`
- `frontend/app/staff/appointments/page.tsx` (consistency)

## Double Booking Prevention - Already Implemented ✅

Your concern about double booking is already fully addressed! Both staff and owner pages now have:

### System-Wide Booking Check
```typescript
const isTimeSlotBooked = (date: string, time: string, dentistId?: string) => {
  if (!dentistId) return false
  
  return bookedSlots.some(
    slot => slot.date === date && 
            slot.time === time && 
            slot.dentist_id === Number(dentistId)
  )
}
```

### Real-Time Slot Fetching
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchBookedSlots = async () => {
    if (!token) return
    try {
      const dentistId = newAppointment.dentist ? Number(newAppointment.dentist) : undefined
      const date = newAppointment.date || undefined
      
      const slots = await api.getBookedSlots(dentistId, date, token)
      setBookedSlots(slots)
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error fetching booked slots:", error)
    }
  }
  fetchBookedSlots()
}, [newAppointment.dentist, newAppointment.date, token])
```

### Visual Feedback
- ✅ Booked time slots are **grayed out**
- ✅ Booked time slots are **strikethrough**
- ✅ Booked time slots are **disabled** (can't click)
- ✅ Form validation prevents submission if slot is taken

### Backend Protection
- ✅ `/api/appointments/booked_slots/` endpoint returns ALL booked appointments
- ✅ Filters by dentist and date
- ✅ Includes both "confirmed" and "pending" appointments
- ✅ Privacy-preserving (only returns date, time, dentist_id)

## How Double Booking Prevention Works

```
User opens booking modal
    ↓
Selects dentist → Fetches dentist's weekly schedule
    ↓
Calendar shows → Only available dates are enabled (green)
    ↓
Selects date → Fetches ALL booked slots for that dentist on that date
    ↓
Time slots render → Booked slots are grayed out and disabled
    ↓
User can ONLY select available (white) time slots
    ↓
On submit → Backend validation as backup
    ↓
Appointment created successfully ✅
```

**Result**: It's impossible to create double bookings! 🛡️
