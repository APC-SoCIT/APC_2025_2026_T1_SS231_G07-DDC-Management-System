# ✅ Appointment Cancellation Request - Implementation Complete

## What Was Implemented

Successfully implemented a complete appointment cancellation workflow where:
1. **Patients** can request appointment cancellations
2. **Staff/Owner** can approve or reject cancellation requests
3. **Approved cancellations** permanently delete the appointment from all user views

---

## How It Works

### For Patients (Patient Appointments Page)

1. Navigate to **Appointments** tab
2. Find a **confirmed** appointment you want to cancel
3. Click the **"Request Cancel"** button (red button next to "Request Reschedule")
4. A modal opens showing:
   - Appointment details (service, date, time)
   - Text area to enter your reason for cancellation (required)
   - Warning that request needs staff approval
5. Click **"Submit Cancellation Request"**
6. Status changes to **"Cancellation Requested"** with a red badge
7. Wait for staff/owner to review

**Result**: 
- If **approved** → Appointment disappears from your list (permanently deleted)
- If **rejected** → Appointment returns to "Confirmed" status

### For Staff/Owner (Appointments Dashboard)

1. Navigate to **Appointments** page
2. Look for appointments with **"Cancellation Requested"** status (red badge)
3. Click to expand the appointment details
4. You'll see a **red notification box** showing:
   - "Cancellation Request Pending" header
   - Patient's reason for cancellation
   - Warning about permanent deletion
   - Two action buttons

5. Choose an action:
   - **"Approve & Delete"** (red button):
     - Confirms you want to delete
     - Permanently removes appointment from database
     - Disappears from all user views (patient, staff, owner)
   
   - **"Reject Cancellation"** (gray button):
     - Confirms you want to reject
     - Returns appointment to "Confirmed" status
     - Patient can continue with the appointment

## Code Changes Summary

### Backend (`backend/api/views.py`)
Modified the `approve_cancel` endpoint to **delete** the appointment instead of just marking it as cancelled:

```python
# OLD (before):
appointment.status = 'cancelled'
appointment.save()

# NEW (after):
appointment.delete()  # Permanent deletion
```

### Frontend

#### Patient Side (`frontend/app/patient/appointments/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Added "Request Cancel" button (red, next to reschedule button)
- ✅ Added cancel request modal with reason field
- ✅ Added `handleCancelRequest` function
- ✅ Updated status colors and labels for `cancel_requested`
- ✅ Shows "Cancellation pending approval..." message

#### Staff Side (`frontend/app/staff/appointments/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Added `cancel_requested` status support
- ✅ Added `cancel_reason` field to interface
- ✅ Added `handleApproveCancel` function (removes from list after deletion)
- ✅ Added `handleRejectCancel` function
- ✅ Added cancellation request notification section with approve/reject buttons
- ✅ Updated status colors and formatting

#### Owner Side (`frontend/app/owner/appointments/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Same changes as staff side
- ✅ Full approve/reject functionality
- ✅ Warning messages about permanent deletion

## Database

The database already has the required fields from migration `0005`:
- `cancel_reason` - Text field for patient's reason
- `cancel_requested_at` - Timestamp when request was made

These fields were added in a previous migration and are ready to use.
