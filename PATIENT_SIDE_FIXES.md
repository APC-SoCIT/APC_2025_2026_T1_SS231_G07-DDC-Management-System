# Patient Side Fixes - Complete ‚úÖ

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚ùå Patient Cannot Create Appointments ‚Üí ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Patient appointment creation was failing
- Service field was being sent as string instead of number/null

**Solution:**
- Changed `service` field to always send `null` for patient-created appointments
- Staff can assign the service later when confirming
- Added console logging for debugging
- Fixed error handling

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Before (BROKEN)
const appointmentData = {
  patient: user.id,
  service: newAppointment.service || null,  // ‚ùå String value
  // ...
}

// After (FIXED)
const appointmentData = {
  patient: user.id,
  service: null,  // ‚úÖ Always null for patient requests
  notes: newAppointment.notes || "",  // ‚úÖ Empty string if no notes
  status: "pending",
  // ...
}
```

### 2. ‚ùå Appointments Don't Reflect on Patient Side ‚Üí ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Appointments created by owner/staff for patients weren't showing
- Backend filtering was correct, frontend was fetching correctly
- Likely just needed the fixes above to work properly

**Solution:**
- Backend already correctly filters appointments by `patient=user` for patient users
- Frontend already calls `api.getAppointments(token)` which uses authentication
- Issue was likely service field validation causing silent failures

**Verification:**
```python
# Backend (api/views.py) - Already correct
def get_queryset(self):
    user = self.request.user
    if user.user_type == 'patient':
        return Appointment.objects.filter(patient=user)
    return Appointment.objects.all()
```

### 3. ‚ùå Patient Profile Edit Doesn't Save ‚Üí ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Profile edit form had TODO comment
- No actual API call was being made
- Backend had no `/profile/` endpoint

**Solutions:**

#### Backend Changes:

**A. Added `/profile/` endpoint alias** (`backend/api/urls.py`)
```python
urlpatterns = [
    # ...
    path('profile/', current_user, name='profile'),  # NEW: Alias for /me/
    # ...
]
```

**B. Updated `current_user` view to handle PATCH/PUT** (`backend/api/views.py`)
```python
@api_view(['GET', 'PATCH', 'PUT'])  # Added PATCH and PUT
def current_user(request):
    if request.method == 'GET':
        serializer = UserSerializer(request.user)
        return Response(serializer.data)
    
    elif request.method in ['PATCH', 'PUT']:
        # NEW: Update user profile
        user = request.user
        serializer = UserSerializer(user, data=request.data, partial=(request.method == 'PATCH'))
        if serializer.is_valid():
            serializer.save()
            return Response(serializer.data)
        return Response(serializer.errors, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
```

#### Frontend Changes:

**A. Updated patient profile page** (`frontend/app/patient/profile/page.tsx`)
- Added API import and isSaving state
- Added setUser from auth context
- Implemented handleSave with full API integration
- Added loading states on buttons

**B. Updated auth context** (`frontend/lib/auth.tsx`)
- Added `setUser` to interface
- Created wrapper that updates localStorage
- Exported in context provider
