# How to Get Your Railway Backend URL

## 🚨 Your Service is Currently "Unexposed"

From your Railway dashboard, I can see **"Unexposed service"** - this means Railway hasn't created a public URL yet!

## 📍 Steps to Generate Your Public URL:

### **Step 1: Go to Settings Tab**
1. In your Railway dashboard, click the **"Settings"** tab at the top
2. (Next to: Deployments, Variables, Metrics)

### **Step 2: Find the Networking Section**
1. Scroll down in Settings until you see **"Networking"** or **"Domains"**
2. You should see a button that says **"Generate Domain"** or **"Add Public Networking"**

### **Step 3: Generate Domain**
1. Click the **"Generate Domain"** button
2. Railway will automatically create a public URL for you
3. The URL will look like: `https://apc-2025-2026-t1-ss231-g07-ddc-management-system-production.up.railway.app`

### **Step 4: Copy Your URL**
1. Once generated, you'll see the URL displayed
2. Copy the entire URL
3. This is your backend API URL!

## 🔗 What to Do With the URL:

### **Test Your Backend:**
Once you have the URL, test these endpoints in your browser:

```
https://your-app.up.railway.app/
https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/
https://your-app.up.railway.app/admin/
```

### **Update Your Frontend:**

1. **For Local Development:**
   Create/update `.env.local` in your frontend folder:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-app.up.railway.app/api
   ```

2. **For Vercel Production:**
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard
   - Select your project
   - Go to Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` = `https://your-app.up.railway.app/api`
   - Redeploy your frontend

## ⚠️ Important Notes:

1. **The deployment is ACTIVE** - your backend is running!
2. You just need to expose it to get a public URL
3. Railway's free tier includes public networking
4. The URL won't change unless you delete and recreate it

## 🎯 Quick Checklist:

- [ ] Click Settings tab in Railway
- [ ] Find Networking/Domains section  
- [ ] Click "Generate Domain"
- [ ] Copy the generated URL
- [ ] Test the URL in browser
- [ ] Add URL to frontend environment variables
- [ ] Test your app!

## 📸 What You're Looking For:

In the **Settings** tab, look for a section that looks like:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Networking                           │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Public Networking                    │
│ [Generate Domain] button             │
│                                      │
│ Or if already generated:             │
│ https://your-app.up.railway.app     │
│ [Copy] [Remove]                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🆘 Still Can't Find It?

If you don't see "Generate Domain" button:

1. Make sure your deployment is successful (it is! ✅)
2. Check that you're on the correct service (not the database)
3. Look for "Public Networking" toggle and enable it
4. Or look for a "+" button to add a domain

**Your deployment is already live! You just need to expose it to the internet!** 🚀
