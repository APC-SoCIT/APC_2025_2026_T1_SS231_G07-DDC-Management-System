2. **GET `/api/appointments/`** - Fetch appointments
   - Auto-filtered by user type (patient sees only theirs, staff/owner see all)
   - Returns computed fields: `patient_name`, `dentist_name`, `service_name`

3. **POST `/api/appointments/`** - Create appointment
   - Now includes `dentist` field
   - Patient appointments: `status='pending'`
   - Staff/Owner appointments: `status='confirmed'`

  const date = new Date(dateStr)
  return date.toLocaleDateString('en-US', { 
    month: 'short', 
    day: 'numeric', 
    year: 'numeric' 
  })
}

// Time: "2:30 PM"
const formatTime = (timeStr: string) => {
  const [hours, minutes] = timeStr.split(':')
  const hour = parseInt(hours)
  const ampm = hour >= 12 ? 'PM' : 'AM'
  const displayHour = hour % 12 || 12
  return `${displayHour}:${minutes} ${ampm}`
}
```

### State Management:
