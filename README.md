## 📜 Introduction

Modern dental clinics face significant operational challenges, with administrative staff managing a high volume of patient inquiries, scheduling, and information dissemination. This manual workload creates a substantial administrative burden, leading to increased costs and potential for error.

This project proposes a transformative solution: a web-based management system integrated with an advanced conversational AI. By automating routine administrative workflows, our system reduces the operational load on staff, allowing them to focus on high-value patient care and engagement activities.

## ⚠️ Limitations

- **Non-Diagnostic Tool:** The system is strictly for administrative and informational purposes. It will not provide any medical diagnoses, treatment advice, or clinical recommendations.
- **Technical Requirements:** All features require a stable internet connection to function. The voice input feature needs a modern web browser with microphone permissions enabled.
- **Data Migration:** The scope does not include the bulk migration or import of data from any pre-existing digital formats (like spreadsheets or other software). All initial data must be entered manually or scanned.
- **Third-Party Integrations:** The platform will operate as a self-contained system. It does not include integration with external software such as accounting systems (e.g., QuickBooks), online payment gateways for patient billing, or dedicated insurance claims processing platforms.
- **AI Performance:** The AI assistant is designed to be highly accurate, but like any language model, its performance is not infallible. There may be instances where it misinterprets complex queries or requires the user to rephrase a question for clarity. Its speech-to-text accuracy is also dependent on the user's audio quality.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js 18 or higher
- Git

### Backend Setup (Windows)

1. **Navigate to the backend directory:**
   ```powershell
   cd "dorotheo-dental-clinic-website\backend"
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   ```powershell
   & "venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1"
   ```

3. **Install dependencies (first time only):**
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *Note: If `psycopg2-binary` fails to install (common on Windows), install core packages manually:*
   ```powershell
   pip install Django==4.2.7 djangorestframework==3.14.0 django-cors-headers==4.3.1 Pillow gunicorn whitenoise dj-database-url python-dotenv
   ```

4. **Run database migrations (first time or after model changes):**
   ```powershell
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Start the development server:**
   ```powershell
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

The backend will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

**Notes:**
- Dependencies only need installation once per environment.
- The project uses SQLite for local development (no PostgreSQL required).
- For production, configure `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` for PostgreSQL.

### Frontend Setup
