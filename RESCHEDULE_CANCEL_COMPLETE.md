## 📋 Overview

This document outlines the complete implementation of the reschedule and cancel request system for the Dorotheo Dental Clinic management system. The feature allows patients to request appointment changes, which must be approved by staff or owner.

**Implementation Date:** October 20, 2025
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## 🎯 Business Requirements Implemented

### Core Requirements
1. ✅ **Patient Request System**
   - Patients can request to reschedule confirmed or missed appointments
   - Patients can request to cancel confirmed appointments
   - All requests require staff/owner approval (not auto-approved)

2. ✅ **Status Management**
   - Removed 'pending' status for new appointments
   - Default status is now 'confirmed' for new bookings
   - Added 'missed' status for appointments that weren't attended
   - New request statuses: 'reschedule_requested', 'cancel_requested'

3. ✅ **Notification System**
   - All appointment actions trigger notifications to staff and owner
   - Notifications include: new appointments, reschedule requests, cancel requests
   - Staff and owner can approve/reject requests directly from notifications

4. ✅ **Approval Workflow**
   - Staff and owner can approve or reject reschedule requests
   - Staff and owner can approve or reject cancellation requests
   - Approved reschedules update appointment date/time
   - Approved cancellations change status to 'cancelled'
   - Rejected requests revert appointment to 'confirmed' status

## 🔧 Backend Implementation

### Database Changes

#### 1. Appointment Model Updates (`backend/api/models.py`)

```python
class Appointment(models.Model):
    STATUS_CHOICES = [
        ('confirmed', 'Confirmed'),
        ('completed', 'Completed'),
        ('cancelled', 'Cancelled'),
        ('reschedule_requested', 'Reschedule Requested'),
        ('cancel_requested', 'Cancel Requested'),
        ('missed', 'Missed'),
    ]
    
    status = models.CharField(
        max_length=30, 
        choices=STATUS_CHOICES, 
        default='confirmed'  # Changed from 'pending'
    )
    
    # New fields for reschedule requests
    requested_date = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)
    requested_time = models.TimeField(null=True, blank=True)
    
    # New field for cancel requests
    cancel_reason = models.TextField(blank=True, null=True)
```

#### 2. AppointmentNotification Model (`backend/api/models.py`)

```python
class AppointmentNotification(models.Model):
    NOTIFICATION_TYPES = [
        ('new_appointment', 'New Appointment'),
        ('reschedule_request', 'Reschedule Request'),
        ('cancel_request', 'Cancel Request'),
    ]
    
    recipient = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    notification_type = models.CharField(max_length=30, choices=NOTIFICATION_TYPES)
    message = models.TextField()
    appointment = models.ForeignKey(Appointment, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    is_read = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```

### API Endpoints

### Helper Functions

#### Notification Creation (`backend/api/views.py`)

```python
def create_appointment_notification(appointment, notification_type, message):
    """
    Creates notifications for all staff members and the owner
    """
    staff_users = User.objects.filter(
        Q(user_type='staff', staff__role__in=['dentist', 'assistant']) |
        Q(user_type='owner')
    )
    
    for user in staff_users:
        AppointmentNotification.objects.create(
            recipient=user,
            appointment=appointment,
            notification_type=notification_type,
            message=message
        )
```
