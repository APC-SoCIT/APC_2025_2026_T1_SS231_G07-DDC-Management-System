# Login, Registration & Navigation Fixes - October 16, 2025 ✅

## All Critical Issues Fixed

---

## ✅ Issue 1: Login Error - "Invalid credentials"
**Problem**: Login was failing with error because code was looking for `response.access` but API returns `response.token`

**Fixed in**: `frontend/lib/auth.tsx`
```typescript
// BEFORE (WRONG)
setToken(response.access)

// AFTER (CORRECT)
setToken(response.token)
```

**Result**: Login now works correctly! ✅

---

## ✅ Issue 2: Email Label on Login Page
**Problem**: Login page showed "Username or Email" which was confusing

**Fixed in**: `frontend/app/login/page.tsx`
- Changed label: "Username or Email" → "Email"
- Changed input type: `type="text"` → `type="email"`
- Added placeholder: "your.email@example.com"

**Result**: Clear, user-friendly email field! ✅

---

## ✅ Issue 3: Register Modal on Login Page
**Problem**: Clicking "Register as Patient" went to homepage instead of opening registration modal

**Fixed in**: `frontend/app/login/page.tsx`
- Changed from `<Link href="/">` to `<button onClick>`
- Added RegisterModal component
- Modal now opens directly on login page

**Result**: Easy registration without leaving login page! ✅

---

## ✅ Issue 4: Patient Logo Navigation
**Problem**: When logged in as patient and clicking logo in sidebar, user would get logged out

**Root Cause**: Homepage navbar wasn't recognizing logged-in state

**Fixed in**: `frontend/components/navbar.tsx`
- Added `useAuth()` hook to navbar
- Navbar now knows when user is logged in
- Shows user avatar instead of login icon when logged in

**Existing Correct Behavior**:
- Patient layout: Logo IS clickable, goes to `/` ✅
- Staff layout: Logo is NOT clickable ✅
- Owner layout: Logo is NOT clickable ✅

**Result**: Patients can click logo to go home without logging out! ✅

## 🔍 Technical Implementation

### File: `frontend/lib/auth.tsx`
```typescript
const login = async (username: string, password: string) => {
  const response = await api.login(username, password)
  setToken(response.token)  // ← Changed from response.access
  setUser(response.user)
  localStorage.setItem("token", response.token)  // ← Changed from response.access
  localStorage.setItem("user", JSON.stringify(response.user))
}
```

### File: `frontend/app/login/page.tsx`
```tsx
// Added import
import RegisterModal from "@/components/register-modal"

// Added state
const [isRegisterOpen, setIsRegisterOpen] = useState(false)

// Email field
<label>Email</label>
<input type="email" placeholder="your.email@example.com" />

// Register button
<button onClick={() => setIsRegisterOpen(true)}>
  Register as Patient
</button>

// Modal component
<RegisterModal isOpen={isRegisterOpen} onClose={() => setIsRegisterOpen(false)} />
```

### File: `frontend/components/navbar.tsx`
```tsx
import { useAuth } from "@/lib/auth"

const { user } = useAuth()

const getDashboardRoute = () => {
  if (!user) return "/login"
  switch (user.user_type) {
    case "patient": return "/patient/dashboard"
    case "staff": return "/staff/dashboard"
    case "owner": return "/owner/dashboard"
    default: return "/login"
  }
}

// In navbar render
<Link href={getDashboardRoute()}>
  {user ? (
    <div className="w-8 h-8 bg-accent rounded-full">
      <span>{user.first_name.charAt(0)}{user.last_name.charAt(0)}</span>
    </div>
  ) : (
    <User className="w-5 h-5" />
  )}
</Link>
```
