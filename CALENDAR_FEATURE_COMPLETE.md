### New Imports
```typescript
import { Calendar } from "@/components/ui/calendar"

for (let i = 0; i < 90; i++) {
  const checkDate = new Date(today)
  checkDate.setDate(today.getDate() + i)
  const dayOfWeek = checkDate.getDay()
  
  const dayAvailability = availability.find(a => a.day_of_week === dayOfWeek)
  if (dayAvailability?.is_available) {
    dates.add(checkDate.toISOString().split('T')[0])
  }
}
```

## Architecture

```
Patient Appointment Booking Flow
=================================

1. Patient selects dentist
   ↓
2. useEffect triggers
   ↓
3. api.getStaffAvailability(dentistId)
   ↓
4. Backend returns weekly schedule:
   [
     { day_of_week: 1, is_available: true, start_time: "09:00", end_time: "17:00" },
     { day_of_week: 2, is_available: true, start_time: "09:00", end_time: "17:00" },
     ...
   ]
   ↓
5. Frontend calculates next 90 days
   ↓
6. For each date, check if day_of_week matches available days
   ↓
7. Build Set of available dates
   ↓
8. Calendar component uses disabled prop to gray out unavailable dates
   ↓
9. Calendar component uses modifiers to highlight available dates (green)
   ↓
10. Patient clicks green date → selectedDate state updates
    ↓
11. Time input appears with available hours
    ↓
12. Patient completes booking
```
