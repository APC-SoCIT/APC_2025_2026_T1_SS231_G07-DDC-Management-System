# FIX: Oro Dental Logo Not Showing

## Problem:
The logo is not displaying on the homepage and other pages because the logo file is missing from the public folder.

## Solution Steps:

### Step 1: Save Your Logo
You need to save the Oro Dental logo image to the public folder.

**Option A: If you have the logo file on your computer:**
1. Copy your logo file (the one with "Oro Dental Clinic" text and tooth icon)
2. Paste it to: `c:\Users\blood\Downloads\dental-clinic-system\frontend\public\`
3. Rename it to: `logo.png`

**Option B: Using PowerShell to create a placeholder:**
Run this command in PowerShell from the frontend folder:
```powershell
cd c:\Users\blood\Downloads\dental-clinic-system\frontend\public
# Then manually add your logo.png file here
```

### Step 2: Verify File Exists
Check that the file exists:
```powershell
cd c:\Users\blood\Downloads\dental-clinic-system\frontend\public
dir logo.png
```

You should see: `logo.png`

### Step 3: Refresh Browser
1. Open your browser
2. Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
3. This will clear cache and reload

## Files Already Updated:

âœ… `frontend/components/navbar.tsx` - Homepage navbar
âœ… `frontend/app/staff/layout.tsx` - Staff sidebar
âœ… `frontend/app/owner/layout.tsx` - Owner sidebar
âœ… `frontend/app/patient/layout.tsx` - Patient sidebar

All files now reference: `<img src="/logo.png" alt="Oro Dental Clinic" />`

## Expected Result:

After saving the logo, you should see the Oro Dental logo in:
- âœ… Homepage navbar (top)
- âœ… Staff dashboard sidebar
- âœ… Owner dashboard sidebar
- âœ… Patient dashboard sidebar
- âœ… Mobile headers on all pages

## Troubleshooting:

**If logo still doesn't show:**

1. **Check file name is exactly:** `logo.png` (lowercase, no spaces)

2. **Check file location:**
   ```
   c:\Users\blood\Downloads\dental-clinic-system\frontend\public\logo.png
   ```

3. **Check browser console for errors:**
   - Press F12
   - Go to Console tab
   - Look for 404 errors about logo.png

4. **Try different format:**
   If you have logo as SVG, save it as `logo.svg` and update code:
   Change `/logo.png` to `/logo.svg` in all layout files

5. **Clear Next.js cache:**
   ```powershell
   cd c:\Users\blood\Downloads\dental-clinic-system\frontend
   rm -r .next
   npm run dev
   ```

## Quick Fix Script:

Run this in PowerShell to verify setup:
```powershell
cd c:\Users\blood\Downloads\dental-clinic-system\frontend

# Check if public folder exists
if (Test-Path "public") {
    Write-Host "âœ“ Public folder exists" -ForegroundColor Green
} else {
    Write-Host "âœ— Public folder missing!" -ForegroundColor Red
}

# Check if logo exists
if (Test-Path "public\logo.png") {
    Write-Host "âœ“ Logo file exists" -ForegroundColor Green
    Get-Item "public\logo.png" | Select-Object Name, Length, LastWriteTime
} else {
    Write-Host "âœ— Logo file missing! Please add logo.png to public folder" -ForegroundColor Red
}
```

**After you save the logo file, the Oro Dental branding will appear throughout the entire system!** ðŸ¦·âœ¨
