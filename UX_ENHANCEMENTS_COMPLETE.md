### Files Modified:

  - ❤️ Expenses (from inventory) - Red gradient
  - 💙 Profit (calculated) - Blue gradient
  - 🧡 Pending (unpaid bills) - Amber gradient

- ✅ **Time Filters**:
  - Daily: Shows today's data
  - Weekly: Last 7 days
  - Monthly: Last 30 days
  - Annual: Last 12 months

- ✅ **Breakdown Tables**:
  - Revenue table: Shows paid transactions with patient/amount/date
  - Expenses table: Shows inventory purchases with item/cost/date
  - Both tables respect selected time filter
  - Scrollable with max height for many entries

- ✅ **Smart Calculations**:

  - Sums amounts and costs
  - Calculates profit (can be negative if expenses > revenue)
  - Shows transaction/item counts

### Mock Data Included:
```typescript
// 8 billing records (₱50,000 total paid, ₱5,000 pending)
// 5 inventory items (₱6,500 total expenses)
// Profit: ₱43,500 (for 30-day period)
```

---

## Technical Implementation

### Search Pattern Used:
```typescript
const filteredItems = items.filter((item) =>
  item.field1.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase()) ||
  item.field2.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase()) ||
  item.field3.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase())
)
```

### Analytics Date Filtering:
```typescript
const getDateRange = () => {
  switch (timeFilter) {
    case "daily": return today
    case "weekly": return today - 7 days
    case "monthly": return today - 30 days
    case "annual": return today - 12 months
  }
}

const filteredBillings = billings.filter(b => 
  new Date(b.date) >= dateRange.start && b.status === "paid"
)
```

## Next Steps

### To Connect to Real API:
Replace mock data arrays with API calls:

```typescript
// Billing
const billings = await fetch('/api/billing').then(r => r.json())

// Inventory
const inventory = await fetch('/api/inventory').then(r => r.json())

// Patients
const patients = await fetch('/api/patients').then(r => r.json())
```

### To Test:
1. Start backend: `cd backend && python manage.py runserver`
2. Start frontend: `cd frontend && pnpm dev`
3. Login as owner/staff
4. Test search bars (type patient names, staff names)
5. Test analytics filters (daily/weekly/monthly/annual)
6. Verify calculations match expected values
