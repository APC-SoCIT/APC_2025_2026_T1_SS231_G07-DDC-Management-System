## Changes Made

### Frontend Updates

#### 1. Owner Patients Page (`frontend/app/owner/patients/page.tsx`)
**Status:** ✅ Replaced with full staff functionality

**Features Added:**
- 📋 Expandable patient rows with detailed information cards
- 🎨 3-column card layout (Personal Info | Medical History | Appointments & Billing)
- ✏️ Inline editing capability
- 📸 **Teeth Image Upload** button integrated
- 🗑️ Delete patient functionality
- 👁️ View patient details
- 🔍 Search and filter (All/Active/Inactive/New)
- ➕ Add new patient modal

**Key Code Changes:**
```tsx
export default function OwnerPatients() {
  // Full state management
  const [showImageUpload, setShowImageUpload] = useState(false)
  const [selectedPatient, setSelectedPatient] = useState<Patient | null>(null)
  
  // Upload teeth image handler
  const handleUploadImage = (patient: Patient, e: React.MouseEvent) => {
    e.stopPropagation()
    setSelectedPatient(patient)
    setShowImageUpload(true)
  }
  
  // TeethImageUpload component integrated
  {showImageUpload && selectedPatient && (
    <TeethImageUpload
      patientId={selectedPatient.id}
      patientName={selectedPatient.name}
      onClose={() => {
        setShowImageUpload(false)
        setSelectedPatient(null)
      }}
      onSuccess={() => {
        setShowImageUpload(false)
        setSelectedPatient(null)
      }}
    />
  )}
}
```

#### 2. Owner Billing Page (`frontend/app/owner/billing/page.tsx`)
**Status:** ✅ Replaced with full staff functionality

**Features Added:**
- 📊 Status tabs (All/Pending/Paid/Cancelled)
- 🔄 Clickable status badges to change billing status
- 🎨 Color-coded status badges:
  - 🟡 Pending (Amber)
  - 🟢 Paid (Green)
  - 🔴 Cancelled (Red)
- 💰 Add SOA functionality
- 📈 Filtering by status

**Key Code Changes:**
```tsx
export default function OwnerBilling() {
  const [activeStatus, setActiveStatus] = useState<'all' | 'pending' | 'paid' | 'cancelled'>('all')
  
  const handleStatusChange = (billingId: number, currentStatus: string) => {
    // Cycle through statuses
    const statusOrder = ['pending', 'paid', 'cancelled']
    const currentIndex = statusOrder.indexOf(currentStatus)
    const nextStatus = statusOrder[(currentIndex + 1) % 3]
    
    setBillings(
      billings.map((b) =>
        b.id === billingId ? { ...b, status: nextStatus, paid: nextStatus === 'paid' } : b
      )
    )
  }
}
```

### Backend Verification

#### Permissions Already Correct ✅

The backend already has proper permissions set up. All ViewSets filter by `user_type == 'patient'` which means:
- ✅ **Staff** can access all patient data
- ✅ **Owner** can access all patient data
- ❌ **Patients** can only see their own data

**Evidence from `backend/api/views.py`:**

```python
class TeethImageViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    def get_queryset(self):
        user = self.request.user
        queryset = TeethImage.objects.all()
        
        # Filter by patient if user is a patient
        if user.user_type == 'patient':
            queryset = queryset.filter(patient=user)
        
        # Filter by patient_id if provided (for staff/owner viewing specific patient)
        patient_id = self.request.query_params.get('patient_id', None)
        if patient_id:
            queryset = queryset.filter(patient_id=patient_id)
        
        return queryset
```

**This pattern is consistent across:**
- `UserViewSet` - ✅
- `ServiceViewSet` - ✅
- `AppointmentViewSet` - ✅
- `ToothChartViewSet` - ✅
- `DentalRecordViewSet` - ✅
- `DocumentViewSet` - ✅
- `InventoryItemViewSet` - ✅
- `BillingViewSet` - ✅
- `TreatmentPlanViewSet` - ✅
- `TeethImageViewSet` - ✅

## Known Issues & Notes

1. **Mock Data**: Both owner pages still use mock data. Will need to connect to actual API endpoints when backend authentication is fully implemented.

2. **Real-time Updates**: After uploading teeth image or changing billing status, page needs manual refresh. Consider adding automatic refresh or optimistic updates.

3. **User Names**: Currently showing user IDs instead of staff names in teeth image metadata. Need to add user serializer relationship.

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Connect to Real API**: Replace mock data with actual API calls
2. **Add Notifications**: Alert owner when billing paid or new patient added
3. **Batch Operations**: Select multiple billings to mark as paid
4. **Export Reports**: Download patient lists and billing reports as PDF/Excel
5. **Audit Log**: Track who uploaded which teeth images
6. **Image Comparison**: Side-by-side comparison of teeth images over time
