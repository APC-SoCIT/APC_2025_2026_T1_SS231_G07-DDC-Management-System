# Patient Appointments View Fix

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Issue:** Appointments were showing in the Appointments page but not appearing in Patient Details view

---

## 🐛 Problem Identified

When viewing a patient's details under the Patients page, their scheduled appointments were not showing up in the "Upcoming Appointments" section, even though those same appointments appeared correctly in the Appointments page.

### Root Cause

In `frontend/app/owner/patients/page.tsx`, the patient data transformation was hardcoding empty values for appointment-related fields:

```typescript
// OLD CODE (Lines 107-108)
upcomingAppointments: [],      // ❌ Hardcoded empty array
pastAppointments: 0,            // ❌ Hardcoded zero
```

The code was only fetching patient data but not fetching or linking their appointments.

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Changes Made:

1. **Added appointments state** (Line 68):
```typescript
const [appointments, setAppointments] = useState<any[]>([])
```

2. **Fetched appointments alongside patients** (Lines 83-184):
```typescript
// Fetch patients and appointments in parallel
const [patientsResponse, appointmentsResponse] = await Promise.all([
  api.getPatients(token),
  api.getAppointments(token)
])
```

3. **Filtered appointments by patient**:
```typescript
// Filter appointments for this patient
const patientAppointments = appointmentsResponse.filter(
  (apt: any) => apt.patient === user.id
)
```

4. **Separated upcoming vs past appointments**:
```typescript
// Upcoming: future dates and not cancelled/completed
const upcomingAppts = patientAppointments
  .filter((apt: any) => {
    const aptDate = new Date(apt.date)
    return aptDate >= today && apt.status !== 'cancelled' && apt.status !== 'completed'
  })
  .map((apt: any) => ({
    date: apt.date,
    time: apt.time,
    type: apt.service_name || "General Consultation",
    doctor: apt.dentist_name || "Dr. Marvin Dorotheo"
  }))
  .sort((a: any, b: any) => new Date(a.date).getTime() - new Date(b.date).getTime())

// Past: dates before today or status completed
const pastAppts = patientAppointments.filter((apt: any) => {
  const aptDate = new Date(apt.date)
  return aptDate < today || apt.status === 'completed'
})
```

5. **Assigned appointment data to patient object**:
```typescript
upcomingAppointments: upcomingAppts,
pastAppointments: pastAppts.length,
```

## 📊 What Now Works

### ✅ Patient Details View Now Shows:

1. **Upcoming Appointments Section**:
   - Displays all future scheduled appointments
   - Shows date, time, service type, and dentist
   - Sorted chronologically (earliest first)
   - Excludes cancelled or completed appointments

2. **Past Appointments Count**:
   - Accurate count of historical appointments
   - Includes completed appointments
   - Includes appointments before today's date

3. **Real-Time Data**:
   - Data refreshes when component loads
   - Synced with appointments database
   - Consistent with Appointments page data

## 🔄 Data Flow

```
1. Component loads
   ↓
2. Fetch patients & appointments in parallel
   ↓
3. For each patient:
   - Filter all appointments where patient_id matches
   - Split into upcoming (future, active) and past (old, completed)
   - Transform appointment data to UI format
   ↓
4. Display in Patient Details panel
```
