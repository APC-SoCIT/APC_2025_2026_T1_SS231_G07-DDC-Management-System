# Appointment System Overhaul - Complete Integration

[See full content in BACKEND_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md - File was too large to recreate]

## Quick Summary

### ✅ Completed:
1. Added `updateAppointment` and `deleteAppointment` to API
2. Fixed Owner Appointments page with full CRUD operations
3. Appointments now save to database and persist
4. Status can be changed: Pending → Confirmed → Completed/Cancelled

### ⏳ TODO:
I need to make the same updates to:
- Staff Appointments page (copy owner implementation)
- Patient Appointments page (add create button, status defaults to "pending")
- Patient Dashboard (show upcoming appointments)

The owner appointments are now fully functional! Would you like me to continue with the staff and patient pages?
