# Calendar-Based Appointment Booking with Dentist Availability

## Feature Overview

The patient appointment booking system now includes a **visual calendar** that automatically highlights available dates based on the selected dentist's weekly schedule.

---

## How It Works

### For Patients (Booking Appointments)

1. **Select a Dentist First**
   - Open the "New Appointment" modal
   - Choose a dentist from the dropdown
   - The system fetches that dentist's weekly availability schedule

2. **Calendar Shows Available Dates**
   - A visual calendar appears after selecting a dentist
   - **Green highlighted dates** = Dentist is available
   - **Grayed out dates** = Dentist is not available or unavailable days
   - Only shows dates for the next 90 days
   - Past dates are automatically disabled

3. **Select Date & Time**
   - Click any green-highlighted date to select it
   - Time input appears with available hours shown below
   - Available hours are based on the dentist's schedule for that day

4. **Complete Booking**
   - Choose service/treatment
   - Add optional notes
   - Submit appointment request

### For Dentists (Setting Availability)

1. **Go to Profile Page**
   - Staff: `/staff/profile`
   - Owner: `/owner/profile`

2. **Scroll to "My Schedule" Section**
   - See weekly calendar (Sunday - Saturday)
   - Toggle availability for each day
   - Set time ranges (e.g., 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM)

3. **Save Availability**
   - Changes reflect immediately in patient booking calendar
   - Patients can only book on days/times marked as available

---

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components

**File**: `app/patient/appointments/page.tsx`

**New State Variables:**
```typescript
const [selectedDate, setSelectedDate] = useState<Date | undefined>(undefined)
const [dentistAvailability, setDentistAvailability] = useState<any[]>([])
const [availableDates, setAvailableDates] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set())
```

**Calendar Component:**
```typescript
import { Calendar } from "@/components/ui/calendar"
```

**Key Features:**
1. **Availability Fetching**: When dentist is selected, fetches their weekly schedule
2. **Date Calculation**: Calculates next 90 days and checks which days match dentist's available days
3. **Calendar Modifiers**: Highlights available dates in green
4. **Disabled Dates**: Automatically disables past dates and unavailable dates
5. **Time Range Display**: Shows dentist's available hours for selected date

### API Integration

**Endpoint Used:**
```typescript
api.getStaffAvailability(dentistId, token)
```

**Response Format:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "day_of_week": 1,  // 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, etc.
    "day_name": "Monday",
    "is_available": true,
    "start_time": "09:00:00",
    "end_time": "17:00:00",
    "staff_name": "Dr. John Smith"
  },
  // ... more days
]
```

### Availability Logic

```typescript
// For each day in next 90 days
for (let i = 0; i < 90; i++) {
  const checkDate = new Date(today)
  checkDate.setDate(today.getDate() + i)
  const dayOfWeek = checkDate.getDay() // 0-6
  
  // Find if dentist has availability for this day of week
  const dayAvailability = availability.find(a => a.day_of_week === dayOfWeek)
  
  // If available, add to available dates set
  if (dayAvailability && dayAvailability.is_available) {
    dates.add(checkDate.toISOString().split('T')[0])
  }
}
```

## Known Limitations

1. **90-Day Window**: Only shows 90 days ahead (design decision to keep data manageable)
2. **Day-Level Granularity**: Highlights entire days, not specific time slots
3. **No Booking Conflicts**: Doesn't check if time slot is already fully booked
4. **Client-Side Calculation**: Availability calculated on frontend (fast but could be server-side)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Calendar not showing available dates

**Check:**
1. Is dentist selected?
2. Has dentist set their availability in profile?
3. Check browser console for API errors
4. Verify `api.getStaffAvailability()` returns data

**Solution:**
- Ask dentist to set their schedule
- Check network tab for failed API calls
- Verify token is valid

### Issue: All dates grayed out

**Possible Causes:**
1. Dentist hasn't set any availability
2. All days marked as "not available"
3. API error fetching availability

**Solution:**
- Show warning message to user
- Contact clinic to set schedule
- Check backend for schedule data

### Issue: Wrong dates highlighted

**Check:**
1. Dentist's schedule saved correctly?
2. Timezone issues?
3. Day of week calculation correct?

**Debug:**
```typescript
console.log('Availability:', dentistAvailability)
console.log('Available dates:', Array.from(availableDates))
```
