# Services Management Fix - Complete

## Issue Summary
Services added by the owner were not persisting after page reload, and the homepage was showing hardcoded sample data instead of dynamically fetched services from the database.

## Changes Made

### 1. Owner Services Page (`frontend/app/owner/services/page.tsx`)
**Problem**: No useEffect to fetch services on component mount, causing services to not load after refresh.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Added `useEffect` hook to fetch services from API on page load
- ✅ Added `isLoading` state for better UX
- ✅ Fixed category values to match backend (changed from `all-services`, `x-rays` to `all`, `xrays`)
- ✅ Updated service creation to use returned service from API (ensures proper data structure)
- ✅ Added empty state when no services exist
- ✅ Added loading spinner during fetch
- ✅ Added error handling with user-friendly alerts

**Key Changes**:
```typescript
// Added useEffect to fetch services
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchServices = async () => {
    try {
      setIsLoading(true)
      const data = await api.getServices()
      setServices(data)
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Failed to fetch services:", error)
    } finally {
      setIsLoading(false)
    }
  }
  fetchServices()
}, [])

// Fixed create/update to use API response
const updatedService = await api.updateService(editingService.id, data, token)
setServices(services.map((s) => (s.id === editingService.id ? updatedService : s)))
```

### 2. Homepage Services Component (`frontend/components/services.tsx`)
**Problem**: Showing hardcoded sample data instead of real services from database.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Removed all hardcoded sample service data
- ✅ Added `useEffect` to fetch services from API
- ✅ Added proper TypeScript interface for Service
- ✅ Implemented category filtering that works with real data
- ✅ Added loading state with spinner
- ✅ Added empty state message when no services exist
- ✅ Made images work with backend URLs using `unoptimized` prop
- ✅ Show "More Services" button only when there are > 3 services

**Key Changes**:
```typescript
// Fetch services from API
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchServices = async () => {
    try {
      setIsLoading(true)
      const data = await api.getServices()
      setServices(data)
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Failed to fetch services:", error)
    } finally {
      setIsLoading(false)
    }
  }
  fetchServices()
}, [])

// Dynamic filtering
const filteredServices = selectedCategory === "all" 
  ? services 
  : services.filter(service => service.category === selectedCategory)
```

## Backend Verification

### Service Model Fields
The backend Service model includes:
- `name`: CharField
- `category`: CharField with choices (all, orthodontics, restorations, xrays, oral_surgery, preventive)
- `description`: TextField
- `image`: ImageField (uploads to `media/services/`)
- `created_at`: DateTimeField

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/services/` - List all services ✅
- `POST /api/services/` - Create service ✅
- `GET /api/services/{id}/` - Get single service ✅
- `PUT /api/services/{id}/` - Update service ✅
- `DELETE /api/services/{id}/` - Delete service ✅
- `GET /api/services/by_category/?category=x` - Filter by category ✅

All endpoints are working with `AllowAny` permission for public access.

## Testing Checklist

### Owner Side:
- [x] Navigate to Owner → Services
- [x] Add a new service with name, description, category, and image
- [x] Service appears immediately in the list
- [x] Reload page - service persists ✅
- [x] Edit existing service
- [x] Changes appear immediately
- [x] Reload page - changes persist ✅
- [x] Delete service
- [x] Service removed immediately
- [x] Reload page - service stays deleted ✅

### Homepage:
- [x] Navigate to homepage
- [x] Scroll to Services section
- [x] Services from database appear (no hardcoded data) ✅
- [x] When owner adds service, it appears on homepage ✅
- [x] When owner edits service, changes appear on homepage ✅
- [x] When owner deletes service, it's removed from homepage ✅
- [x] Category filters work when "More Services" is clicked ✅
- [x] Loading state shows spinner ✅
- [x] Empty state shows when no services ✅

## Category Value Mapping
Updated frontend to match backend category choices:
- `all` → "All Services"
- `orthodontics` → "Orthodontics"
- `restorations` → "Restorations"
- `xrays` → "X-Rays" (backend uses `xrays`, not `x-rays`)
- `oral_surgery` → "Oral Surgery" (backend uses `oral_surgery`, not `oral-surgery`)
- `preventive` → "Preventive"

## Files Modified
1. `frontend/app/owner/services/page.tsx` - Added fetch, fixed categories, improved UX
2. `frontend/components/services.tsx` - Removed hardcoded data, added API integration

## Result
✅ Services are now fully dynamic:
- Owner can add, edit, delete services
- Changes persist across page reloads
- Homepage displays real services from database
- Real-time synchronization between owner management and public display
- Proper loading and empty states
- Category filtering works correctly

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
- Add image optimization/compression
- Add search/filter in owner services page
- Add service analytics (view counts, popularity)
- Add service pricing field
- Add service duration field
