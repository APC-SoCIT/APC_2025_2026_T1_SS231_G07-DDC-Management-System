- âœ… Applied to both staff and owner appointments pages

## In Progress ðŸ”„

### 2. Backend Dental Records System
**Status**: Starting implementation

**Backend Changes Needed**:
1. Create `DentalRecord` model:
   - Links to Appointment (OneToOne or ForeignKey)
   - Patient reference
   - Date of service
   - Treatment performed
   - Dentist who performed
   - Diagnosis
   - Notes
   - Status (from completed appointment)

2. Create `XRayImage` model:
   - Patient reference
   - Image file (ImageField)
   - Date uploaded
   - Description/notes
   - Uploaded by (staff/owner)
   - Related appointment (optional)

3. Update Appointment model:
   - Add automatic dental record creation when status â†’ 'completed'
   - Or create signal to auto-generate dental records

4. Add API endpoints:
   - `/api/dental-records/` - List patient's dental records
   - `/api/dental-records/<id>/` - Get specific record details
   - `/api/xray-images/` - Upload/list X-ray images
   - `/api/xray-images/<id>/` - Download specific X-ray image

**Files to Modify**:
- `backend/api/models.py` - Add DentalRecord and XRayImage models
- `backend/api/serializers.py` - Add serializers for new models
- `backend/api/views.py` - Add viewsets and endpoints
- `backend/api/urls.py` - Register new routes
- Create migration for new models

### 3. Frontend Dental Records UI
**Patient Side**:
- Replace "Medical History" with "Dental Records"
- Show list of past completed appointments
- Click to view overlay/modal with:
  - Date of appointment
  - Treatment performed
  - Dentist name
  - Diagnosis
  - Notes
  - Associated X-rays (if any)

- Add "Dental Documents" section:
  - List of X-ray images with dates
  - Download button for each image
  - Preview thumbnail (optional)

**Staff/Owner Side**:
- In Patient tab/details:
  - "Dental Records" section showing all past appointments
  - Click to view full details overlay
  - Add X-ray upload button next to "Upload Teeth Image"
  - X-ray management (view, download, delete)

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `frontend/app/patient/records/page.tsx` - Rename/redesign as Dental Records
- `frontend/app/patient/documents/page.tsx` - NEW: X-ray documents page
- `frontend/app/staff/patients/[id]/page.tsx` - Add dental records view
- `frontend/app/owner/patients/[id]/page.tsx` - Add dental records view
- `frontend/lib/api.ts` - Add dental records and X-ray API functions

### 4. Cancel Appointment Request (Patient Side)
**Similar to Reschedule Feature**:
- Add "Request Cancellation" button for confirmed appointments
- Modal explaining cancellation request
- Patient can add reason/notes
- Status changes to 'cancel_requested'
- Orange badge for cancel requests
- Staff/Owner can approve (cancel) or reject (keep confirmed)

**Backend Changes**:
- Add `cancel_requested` to status choices
- Add fields: `cancel_reason`, `cancel_requested_at`
- Add actions: `approve_cancel`, `reject_cancel`

**Frontend Changes**:
- Add cancel request UI in patient appointments
- Add approve/reject UI in staff/owner appointments

### 5. Calendar Appointment Details Fix
**Current Issue**: Clicking dates with appointments doesn't show details

**Solution**:
- Update calendar click handler to show appointment details
- Display overlay/popover with:
  - Patient name
  - Time
  - Treatment/Service
  - Dentist
  - Status
- Apply to both owner and staff dashboards

**Files to Modify**:
- `frontend/app/owner/dashboard/page.tsx`
- `frontend/app/staff/dashboard/page.tsx`

### 6. Treatment Plans Integration
**Goal**: When staff/owner creates appointment, it should:
1. Use services from owner's service management
2. Show up in upcoming appointments
3. On appointment day â†’ show in "Appointments Today"
4. When completed â†’ automatically create dental record
5. Dental record visible in patient's records

**This is mostly done with the changes above**:
- âœ… Services from owner's service management (dropdown)
- âœ… Shows in upcoming appointments
- âœ… Shows in today's appointments (already implemented)
- ðŸ”„ Need: Auto-create dental record on completion
- ðŸ”„ Need: Display in patient records

### 7. Dr. Dr. Duplication Check
**Investigation Needed**:
- Check if old data has "Dr." prefix in database
- The current code shows: `Dr. {first_name} {last_name}`
- If database has first_name = "Dr. Marvin", it shows "Dr. Dr. Marvin"

**Solution**:
- Check database data
- Remove "Dr." prefix from existing data if present
- Or: Add conditional rendering to strip "Dr." if already present

## Priority Implementation Order

1. **High Priority** (Immediate):
   - [ ] Backend: Create DentalRecord and XRayImage models
   - [ ] Backend: Add dental records API endpoints
   - [ ] Frontend: Fix calendar appointment details display
   - [ ] Fix Dr. Dr. duplication if database issue

2. **Medium Priority** (Next):
   - [ ] Frontend: Replace Medical History with Dental Records
   - [ ] Frontend: Add X-ray upload/download functionality
   - [ ] Add cancel request feature (backend + frontend)

3. **Low Priority** (Polish):
   - [ ] Auto-create dental records from completed appointments
   - [ ] Email notifications for dental records
   - [ ] Enhanced dental record details

## Implementation Steps - Phase 1 (Backend)

### Step 1: Create Models
```python
# backend/api/models.py

class DentalRecord(models.Model):
    patient = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='dental_records')
    appointment = models.OneToOneField(Appointment, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='dental_record', null=True)
    date = models.DateField()
    treatment = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    dentist = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True, related_name='performed_treatments')
    diagnosis = models.TextField(blank=True)
    notes = models.TextField(blank=True)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    
class XRayImage(models.Model):
    patient = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='xray_images')
    image = models.ImageField(upload_to='xray_images/')
    description = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=True)
    notes = models.TextField(blank=True)
    uploaded_by = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True, related_name='uploaded_xrays')
    dental_record = models.ForeignKey(DentalRecord, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True, related_name='xrays')
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```

### Step 2: Create Serializers
### Step 3: Create ViewSets
### Step 4: Register URLs
### Step 5: Create Migration
### Step 6: Test API endpoints

## Implementation Steps - Phase 2 (Frontend)

### Step 1: Update API client
### Step 2: Create Dental Records page
### Step 3: Create X-ray upload component
### Step 4: Update patient records page
### Step 5: Add dental records view to staff/owner

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Service dropdown works in staff/owner appointment creation
- [ ] Appointments created with correct service IDs
- [ ] Calendar shows appointment details on click
- [ ] Completed appointments create dental records
- [ ] Dental records visible to patient
- [ ] Staff/owner can view patient dental records
- [ ] X-ray images can be uploaded
- [ ] X-ray images can be downloaded
- [ ] Cancel request workflow works
- [ ] No "Dr. Dr." duplication

## Notes

- Dental records should be read-only for patients
- Staff/owner can edit/add notes to dental records
- X-ray images should be secure (only patient and staff can view)
- Consider HIPAA compliance for medical images
- Add image size/format validation for X-rays
