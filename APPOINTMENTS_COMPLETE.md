# Complete Appointment System - Full Backend Integration ✅

## 🎉 Overview
The appointment system has been completely overhauled with full backend API integration. All appointments now persist to the database and sync in real-time across all user types (Owner, Staff, Patient).

## 📊 Workflow Summary

### **Complete Cross-User Appointment Flow:**
```

│  • Creates appointment request                             │
│  • Status: PENDING (yellow badge)                          │

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Backend API**
- **Model:** `Appointment` with ForeignKeys to User (patient, dentist) and Service
- **Serializer:** Computed fields (patient_name, patient_email, dentist_name, service_name)
- **ViewSet:** Full CRUD operations with user-based filtering
- **Endpoints:**
  - `GET /api/appointments/` - List appointments
  - `POST /api/appointments/` - Create appointment
  - `PATCH /api/appointments/{id}/` - Update appointment
  - `DELETE /api/appointments/{id}/` - Delete appointment

### **Frontend API Client** (`lib/api.ts`)
```typescript
export const api = {
  getAppointments: async (token: string) => { /* ... */ },
  createAppointment: async (data: any, token: string) => { /* ... */ },
  updateAppointment: async (id: number, data: any, token: string) => { /* ... */ },
  deleteAppointment: async (id: number, token: string) => { /* ... */ },
}
```
