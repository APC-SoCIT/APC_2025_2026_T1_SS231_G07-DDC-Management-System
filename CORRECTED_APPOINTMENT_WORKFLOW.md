### 4. Missed Appointment Handling

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Frontend Changes (patient/appointments/page.tsx)

1. **Removed status from booking:**
   ```typescript
   // BEFORE ❌
   status: "pending", // Patients create pending appointments
   
   // AFTER ✅
   // No status - backend will set to 'confirmed' and notify staff/owner
   ```

2. **Changed button text:**
   ```
   BEFORE ❌: "Submit Request"
   AFTER ✅: "Book Appointment"
   ```

3. **Changed success message:**
   ```
   BEFORE ❌: "Appointment request submitted! Our staff will confirm it soon."
   AFTER ✅: "Appointment booked successfully! Staff and owner have been notified."
   ```

4. **Updated modal header:**
   ```
   BEFORE ❌: "Request Appointment"
   AFTER ✅: "Book Appointment"
   ```

5. **Updated info message:**
   ```
   BEFORE ❌: "Your appointment request will be marked as 'pending' until confirmed by our staff."
   AFTER ✅: "Your appointment will be booked immediately and staff/owner will be notified."
   ```

---

## ⏳ TODO: Still Need Implementation

### Backend Automation
1. **Auto-mark missed appointments**
   - Daily cron job to check passed appointment dates
   - If appointment.date < today AND status = 'confirmed'
   - Set status = 'missed'

### Staff/Owner Features
2. **Manual "Mark as Missed" button**
   - Add button in staff/owner appointment view
   - Allow manual status change to 'missed'
   - Useful for no-shows on appointment day

3. **Manual "Mark as Completed" button**
   - Add button for after appointment is done
   - Changes status from 'confirmed' → 'completed'
   - Moves to patient history
