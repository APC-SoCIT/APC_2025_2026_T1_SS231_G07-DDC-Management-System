---

## 📈 Performance Considerations

### Implemented
- ✅ Efficient database queries with select_related/prefetch_related
- ✅ Notification polling limited to 30-second intervals
- ✅ Lazy loading of appointment details
- ✅ Optimized API payloads

### Future Optimizations
- ⏳ WebSocket for real-time notifications (remove polling)
- ⏳ Redis caching for notification counts
- ⏳ Database indexes on frequently queried fields
- ⏳ Pagination for appointments and notifications

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **No Email Notifications**
   - Patients don't receive email when request is approved/rejected
   - Recommendation: Implement email notifications as next step

2. **No Real-Time Updates**
   - Uses polling instead of WebSockets
   - 30-second delay for notifications
   - Recommendation: Implement WebSocket for instant updates

3. **No Request History**
   - Cannot view past reschedule/cancel requests
   - Recommendation: Add audit log table

4. **No Request Limits**
   - Patients can request unlimited reschedules
   - Recommendation: Add rate limiting (e.g., max 3 per appointment)
