- Chatbot is simple keyword matching, not AI
- No voice commands or speech recognition
- No intelligent recommendations

‚ùå **NOT fully automated:**
- Manual appointment approval by staff
- Manual payment processing (no gateway integration)
- No automated notifications or reminders
- No automatic PDF generation
- No scheduled background tasks

‚ùå **NOT with strict business rule enforcement:**
- No time slot conflict prevention
- No consultation-first requirement
- No advance booking restrictions
- No operating hours validation
- No 24-hour cancellation policy enforcement

---

## üí° RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

### High Priority (Core Functionality Gaps)
1. Implement time slot validation to prevent double-booking
2. Add appointment time validation against clinic operating hours
3. Implement email notification system for confirmations and reminders
4. Add password reset functionality
5. Enforce one appointment per patient per day rule

### Medium Priority (Enhanced Features)
1. Integrate payment gateway (e.g., PayPal, Stripe, GCash)
2. Add automated SOA/receipt PDF generation
3. Implement date range filtering and export for financial reports
4. Add inventory usage tracking and transaction history
5. Enforce consultation-before-treatment business rule

### Low Priority (Advanced Features)
1. If desired: Implement actual AI/ML for appointment booking (using NLP libraries)
2. If desired: Add voice command support using Web Speech API
3. If desired: Build recommendation system using patient history
4. Add multi-language support
5. Implement telemedicine video consultation integration
