## 🔧 Services Management Fix (CRITICAL)

### Problem Solved
- ❌ Services not persisting after page reload
- ❌ Homepage showing hardcoded sample data
- ❌ No sync between owner management and public display

### Solution Implemented
✅ **Owner Services Page**:
- Added `useEffect` to fetch services on load
- Fixed category values to match backend
- Proper loading and empty states
- Error handling with alerts

✅ **Homepage Services**:
- Removed ALL hardcoded data
- Fetches real services from database
- Dynamic category filtering
- Loading spinner + empty state
- Real-time synchronization

**Result**: Services are now fully dynamic! Add → Appears on homepage. Edit → Updates everywhere. Delete → Removed everywhere.
