# ðŸ¦· Dorotheo Dental Clinic System - Data Flow Diagram (DFD) Documentation

This document provides a detailed, text-based Data Flow Diagram (DFD) for the Dorotheo Dental Clinic System. It outlines how data moves through the system, the major processes involved, the data stores used, and the external entities that interact with it.

The documentation is structured hierarchically across three levels:
* **Level 0 (Context Diagram):** A high-level overview showing the entire system as a single process.
* **Level 1 (System Processes):** Decomposes the system into its main functional processes.
* **Level 2 (Sub-Processes):** Provides a more detailed breakdown of the individual processes from Level 1.

---

## âœ¨ Key Feature: Integrated Clinic Patient Workflow

This documentation now includes the complete, end-to-end workflow for a patient visit, seamlessly integrated into the existing DFD structure. This process covers four key stages:

1.  **Arrival & Registration:** Handled within **Process 3.0 (Manage Patient Records)**, where the Receptionist admits new or existing patients.
2.  **Consultation:** Managed by the Dentist under **Process 3.0**, where treatment details and consumed inventory are recorded.
3.  **Billing & Payment:** The `Completed Treatment Info` flows into **Process 4.0 (Manage Billing & Inventory)** to automatically generate invoices and process patient payments.
4.  **Exit & Follow-Up:** Concludes with the Receptionist scheduling a follow-up appointment via **Process 2.0 (Manage Appointments)**.

### How to Identify Changes
All new or significantly expanded components (processes, data stores, or data flows) related to this workflow are marked with a **`(NEW)`** tag for easy identification within the documentation below.
