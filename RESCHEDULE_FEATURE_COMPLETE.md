# Reschedule Feature - Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview
The reschedule request system has been fully implemented, allowing patients to request changes to their confirmed appointments, and staff/owner to review and approve or reject these requests.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Patient Side (`frontend/app/patient/appointments/page.tsx`)
- ✅ **Request Reschedule Button**: Available for confirmed appointments
- ✅ **Reschedule Modal**: Shows current appointment details and allows editing:
  - Date picker for new date
  - Time selector for new time
  - **Service dropdown** (populated from database)
  - **Dentist dropdown** (shows only "Dr. FirstName LastName" format)
  - Notes field for explaining the request
- ✅ **Status Display**: Orange badge for "Reschedule Requested" status
- ✅ **Requested Changes Display**: Shows comparison of current vs requested appointment details
- ✅ **All fields required**: Date, time, service, and dentist must be selected

### 2. Staff Side (`frontend/app/staff/appointments/page.tsx`)
- ✅ **Reschedule Detection**: Orange badge for reschedule_requested status
- ✅ **Expanded Reschedule Section**: Shows when clicking on a reschedule request:
  - Current appointment details (white card)
  - Requested changes (orange card)
  - Patient's notes
  - Approve and Reject buttons
- ✅ **Approve Functionality**: Moves reschedule data to main appointment fields, status → confirmed
- ✅ **Reject Functionality**: Clears reschedule data, reverts status → confirmed
- ✅ **Status Formatting**: Displays "Reschedule Requested" instead of "reschedule_requested"

### 3. Owner Side (`frontend/app/owner/appointments/page.tsx`)
- ✅ **Same Features as Staff**: Identical reschedule approval interface
- ✅ **Reschedule Section**: Side-by-side comparison of current vs requested
- ✅ **Approve/Reject Buttons**: Full control over reschedule requests
- ✅ **Status Formatting**: Properly formatted status labels

### 4. Backend (`backend/api/`)
- ✅ **Database Schema** (`models.py`):
  ```python
  reschedule_date = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)
  reschedule_time = models.TimeField(null=True, blank=True)
  reschedule_service = models.ForeignKey(Service, null=True, blank=True, related_name='reschedule_appointments')
  reschedule_dentist = models.ForeignKey(User, null=True, blank=True, related_name='reschedule_appointments')
  reschedule_notes = models.TextField(blank=True)
  status = models.CharField(max_length=25, choices=STATUS_CHOICES)  # includes 'reschedule_requested'
  ```

- ✅ **API Endpoints** (`views.py`):
  - `POST /api/appointments/{id}/approve_reschedule/` - Approves reschedule request
  - `POST /api/appointments/{id}/reject_reschedule/` - Rejects reschedule request

- ✅ **Serializers** (`serializers.py`):
  - Added `reschedule_service_name` computed field
  - Added `reschedule_dentist_name` computed field

- ✅ **Migration Applied**: `0004_appointment_reschedule_date_and_more.py`

### 5. Frontend API Client (`frontend/lib/api.ts`)
- ✅ `approveReschedule(id, token)`: Calls approve endpoint
- ✅ `rejectReschedule(id, token)`: Calls reject endpoint

## User Experience Improvements

### Service Selection
- **Before**: Text input field - inconsistent data, typos
- **After**: Dropdown populated from database - standardized services

### Dentist Display
- **Before**: "Dr. Marvin Dorotheo (Owner/Dentist)" - verbose
- **After**: "Dr. Marvin Dorotheo" - clean, professional

### Reschedule Status
- **Visual Indicator**: Orange color (#FFA500 theme) clearly distinguishes reschedule requests
- **Formatted Label**: "Reschedule Requested" instead of raw status value
- **Side-by-Side Comparison**: Easy to see what's changing

## Workflow

### Patient Workflow
1. Patient views their confirmed appointments
2. Clicks "Request Reschedule" button
3. Modal opens showing current appointment details
4. Patient selects new date, time, service, and dentist
5. Optionally adds notes explaining the request
6. Submits reschedule request
7. Appointment status changes to "Reschedule Requested" (orange badge)
8. Patient sees both current and requested details

### Staff/Owner Workflow
1. Staff/Owner sees orange "Reschedule Requested" badge in appointment list
2. Clicks on appointment to expand details
3. Sees dedicated reschedule section with:
   - Current appointment (white card)
   - Requested changes (orange card)
   - Patient's notes
4. Reviews the requested changes
5. Either:
   - **Approves**: Appointment updated with new details, status → "Confirmed"
   - **Rejects**: Reschedule data cleared, appointment keeps original details, status → "Confirmed"
6. Patient is notified via alert (can be enhanced with email notifications)

## Technical Details

### Status Flow
```
pending → confirmed → reschedule_requested → [approve] → confirmed (with new data)
                                          ↓ [reject]  ↓ confirmed (original data)
```

### Database Changes
- **Non-breaking**: All reschedule fields are nullable
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing appointments unaffected
- **Atomic Updates**: Approve/reject operations are transactional

### Color Coding
- **Pending**: Yellow (`bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-700`)
- **Confirmed**: Green (`bg-green-100 text-green-700`)
- **Cancelled**: Red (`bg-red-100 text-red-700`)
- **Completed**: Blue (`bg-blue-100 text-blue-700`)
- **Reschedule Requested**: Orange (`bg-orange-100 text-orange-700`)
