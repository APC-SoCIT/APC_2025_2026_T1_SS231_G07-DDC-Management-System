# Now supports email-based login
user = authenticate(username=username, password=password)

# If fails, try email
if not user:
    user_obj = User.objects.get(email=username)
    user = authenticate(username=user_obj.username, password=password)
```

#### 2. User Model (models.py)
```python
# Email is now unique and required
email = models.EmailField(unique=True, blank=False)
```

#### 3. Registration (register-modal.tsx)
```typescript
const registrationData = {
  username: formData.email,  // ✅ Email as username
  email: formData.email,
  // ... other fields
}
```
