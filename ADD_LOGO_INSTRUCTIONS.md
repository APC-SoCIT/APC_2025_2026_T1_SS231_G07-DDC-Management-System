# Add Oro Dental Logo Instructions

## Quick Steps:

1. **Save the logo image** you attached as:
   - **Filename**: `logo.png`
   - **Location**: `c:\Users\blood\Downloads\dental-clinic-system\frontend\public\logo.png`

2. That's it! The code is already updated to use your logo.

## What I've Updated:

âœ… **Staff Layout** - Shows Oro Dental logo (non-clickable)
âœ… **Owner Layout** - Shows Oro Dental logo (non-clickable)
âœ… **Patient Layout** - Shows Oro Dental logo (clickable, goes to homepage)

## Logo Placement:

- **Mobile Header**: Logo appears at height of 40px (h-10)
- **Desktop Sidebar**: Logo appears at height of 56px (h-14)
- **Auto-sizing**: Logo maintains aspect ratio (w-auto)
- **Centered**: Logo is centered in the sidebar

## If Logo Doesn't Appear:

Make sure:
1. File is named exactly `logo.png` (lowercase)
2. File is in the `public` folder
3. Refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
4. Check browser console for any errors

## Alternative Logo Formats:

If you have the logo in a different format, you can also save it as:
- `logo.svg` (for vector graphics)
- `logo.jpg` (for JPEG format)

Then update the filename in the code by changing `/logo.png` to `/logo.svg` or `/logo.jpg`
